# Counting days temperature higher than 90 degrees.

This is part of a project on "the causality between temperature and mortality"

I have used high resolution daily temperature data collected from [NOAA](https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/tables/temperature.html).

*this dataset is available in netCDF format, which is a geospatial file format. I used QGIS to extract the data in .csv format. I have written a detailed step-by-step description of how to extract the data from CDF to .csv, which is [here](https://moumitaghorai.medium.com/easiest-way-to-convert-data-from-geospatial-format-to-csv-d1c81f571238).
